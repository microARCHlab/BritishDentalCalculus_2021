The British data (n=35 samples) was analyzed mainly using <a href="https://qiime2.org//">qiime2</a>. Some specific questions were tackled via qiime1 (g tests), R (network analysis), and LefSE (dietary/community relationships). On this repository, we have uploaded all the available analysis. These analyses were performed in a Unix enviornment (e.g., Mac OSX)
